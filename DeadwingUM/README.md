# DeadwingUM

**DeadwingUM** is an **example of an application** for interaction between usermode and SMM. This example can be used as an example to show how to work with the static library `DeadwingCppLib`, as well as for real work with the same application (with some modifications).

In order to build the example, you **need** to first build `DeadwingCppLib`. You can also customize the static library connection in the project settings.
